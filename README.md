jsCalculator
============

This is a simple calculator.  It isn't fancy -- you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide serially over any number of operands, but no order of operations or anything crazy like that.

Tech Stack:
This application was built on Flask/Python.  All of the calculator functionality is achieved using javascript.
